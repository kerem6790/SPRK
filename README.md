The diagram above represents the full technical flow of SPARK, showing how each component interacts across backend, smart contracts, and Zircuit infrastructure:

‚∏ª

üéõÔ∏è SPRK Backend
	‚Ä¢	Handles influencer onboarding and social media verification
	‚Ä¢	Prevents fake profiles by validating off-chain credentials
	‚Ä¢	After verification, enables NFT smart contract deployment

Tech: Node.js, Express (future), off-chain API calls

‚∏ª

üîó Smart Contract Layer (On Zircuit)
	‚Ä¢	Influencers deploy ERC-721 contracts to Zircuit Testnet
	‚Ä¢	Supporter mints trigger on-chain contract functions
	‚Ä¢	Marketplace operates fully on-chain for secondary trades

Tech: Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin standards

‚∏ª

üõ°Ô∏è Zircuit Infrastructure
	‚Ä¢	All transactions (mint & trade) flow through Zircuit‚Äôs Sequencer
	‚Ä¢	SLS (Sequencer-Level Security) applies:
‚Üí Transaction simulation
‚Üí AI & rule-based malice detection
‚Üí Quarantine of suspicious transactions before block inclusion

Provides protection against bots, money laundering, and exploits transparently

‚∏ª

üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (User Interface)
	‚Ä¢	Built with Next.js and React
	‚Ä¢	Integrates MetaMask & ethers.js for direct contract interaction
	‚Ä¢	Shows reputation metrics and transaction feedback in real-time


## üë• User & Influencer Flow

SPRK creates two distinct, but connected experiences for the ecosystem:

### üöÄ For Supporters (Users)
Everyday users can:

1. Discover emerging influencers on the platform  
2. Invest early by minting limited supporter NFTs  
3. Trade NFTs on the marketplace as influencer popularity grows and make profit  
4. Monitor their impact and social reputation via transparent Fame & Community Scores  
5. Rely on Zircuit's SLS to ensure their transactions are protected from bots, spam, and manipulation  

This flow enables fans to gain early access, while building social credibility and benefiting from influencer growth.

### üé§ For Influencers (Creators)
Rising creators can:

1. Onboard to the platform by connecting social media accounts and their wallets
2. Deploy their own NFT collection directly on Zircuit  
3. Build community through exclusive content or perks for NFT holders  
4. Track their growth and credibility through real-time reputation metrics  
5. Leverage SPRK's security-first infrastructure to avoid exploitation, fake hype, or bot attacks  

This gives influencers early financial and community support, with manipulation-resistant growth.
