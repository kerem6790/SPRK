# SPARK - Influencer NFT Launchpad & Marketplace (Zircuit)

**What is SPARK?**
SPARK is an influencer-focused NFT Launchpad and Marketplace built on the Zircuit blockchain. It enables early-stage financial and community support for rising influencers, while integrating Zircuit’s Sequencer-Level Security (SLS) to prevent bot mints, fake hype, and exploit attempts.

**Key Features:**
✅ Influencer onboarding and social verification  
✅ Limited NFT collections for early supporters  
✅ Real-time Fame Score and Community Score system  
✅ NFT Marketplace for trading supporter NFTs  
✅ SLS quarantine integration for bot/spam protection  
✅ SocialFi experience with built-in reputation and trust  

**Core Value:**
SPARK empowers fans to invest early in future influencers, while influencers gain both visibility and funding in a secure, manipulation-resistant environment.

**Security Position:**
While security is not the core product pitch, Zircuit’s SLS provides an invisible defense layer that protects users without compromising UX.

**Next Steps in Development:**
- Smart Contract setup (NFT collections)  
- Frontend Launchpad with basic mint UI  
- SLS quarantine check integration  
- Placeholder social reputation and growth indicators
