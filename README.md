## What is SPARK?

Emerging influencers need more than just social visibility — they need financial and community support. Yet today, fans have no trusted way to back rising talent transparently, while avoiding bots, fake hype, and exploit risks.

SPARK fixes this by letting users discover and invest early in creators through secure NFT launches, reputation tracking, and a social layer — all powered by Zircuit's SLS.

## Solution: Early Access Meets Zircuit Security

SPARK enables early influencer investment through NFT launches and a social reputation system — with Zircuit's SLS providing invisible protection.

✅ Supporters invest via limited NFTs tied to influencer growth
✅ NFT value reflects popularity, creating organic FOMO
✅ Real-time reputation scores for social transparency
✅ Zircuit SLS quarantines bots, exploits, and malicious activity before block inclusion
